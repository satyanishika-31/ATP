const itEmployees=employees.filter(e=>e.department==="IT");

const withBonus=employees.map(e=>({e,netSalary:e.salary*1.1}));

const totalPayout=employees.reduce((sum,e)=>sum+e.salary,0);

const lowSalary=employees.find(e=>e.salary===30000);

const nehaIndex=employees.findIndex(e=>e.name==="Neha");

console.log({itEmployees,withBonus,totalPayout,lowSalary,nehaIndex});
